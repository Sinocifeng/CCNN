## CCNN :  Concept-cognitive Neural Network

### 1. Introduction

This is the code for CCNN.
The files/Directoryâ€Œ are:
- data : Data needed during storage
- dataPrepare : Code to generate datasets
- model : The model code
- tools : The auxiliary functions during program execution
- fequi_gen.py : gen fair equiconcept
- fequi_nums.py : predict the upper-bound
- nodeemb.py : gen node embeddings


### 2. Notes
  We use .pkl file to storage data in our codes. So, you need use pickle to read datas.
